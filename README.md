Password Generator


In this challenge I am generating a new and secure password that meets the following criteria:

When button is clicked a user is given a series of prompts for password criteria

When prompted user selects criteria to include in password

When prompted for length user chooses 8-128 characters

When prompted for character types user confirms lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and/or numbers

When each prompt is answered then input should be selected

When all prompts are answered the password with selected criteria is generated

When password is generated it will be displayed in alert or written to page
